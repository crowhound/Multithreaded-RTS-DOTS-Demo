# Self-Learning Project
This is one of my projects I am doing to either learn something new, improve on something I already know how to do, or to try a different way to do something compared to how I currently am doing it.
The current progress report is at the bottom of the read me.

# What am I trying to learn?
Currently I am trying to learn how to use Unity's most recently added features in the DOTS, Burst, and Mathematics package updates.
These features allow for in some cases over 100x increase in performance. Not a 100% increase, but a full 100 times increase.

This project is aimed at learning how to use the Unit Job system to properly handle multithreading jobs with the burst compiler to 
bring out the most performance possible with the smallest memory footprint.

## Learning Resources
Someone highly regarded in the Unity community made a seven hour learning course that goes over some of the stuff I wanted to learn more of. 
Going through the training video than adding my own features on top of it for more hands on expierence with the DOTS technology's new features.

## Current Progress
- Multithreading move commands for selected units are working
- Selected units have a visual indicator to show they are selected.
- Have Entity baker components to bake authoring data from normal gameobjects into a entity IComponentData to allow for the best performance possible.


## Currently Working On Finishing
- UI and input commands for easier selecting units.
